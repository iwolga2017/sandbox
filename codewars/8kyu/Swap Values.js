// I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.

// Can you figure out what's wrong here?

let swapValues = (args) => { return args.reverse();
    // let [a, b] = args;
    // [a, b] = [b, a];
    // return [a, b];
    
  };
