            <h2>Here's a time line of Anton Chekhov's life:</h2>
            <ul class="trubute-info__list">
                <li>
                    Anton Pavlovich Chekhov was a <strong>famous Russian playwright and physician</strong>. He is also considered to be one of the greatest writers of short stories in the world. His best short stories are held in high esteem by other writers and critics. Throughout most of his literary career Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor.

                <li>
                    Anton Chekhov was born on <strong>January 29th, 1860 in Taganrog</strong>, which is a port-city in south of Russia. He was the third of six surviving children. His father was a son of a former serf. By nature his father was physically abusive which was hidden from prying eyes. Many historians stated that Chekhov’s father served as the model for many portraits of hypocrisy in his works. His mother was an excellent story-teller and a kind-hearted woman.

                    Chekhov <strong>attended a school for Greek boys and the Taganrog gymnasium</strong>, which is now renamed the Chekhov Gymnasium. He also sang at his father’s choir at the Greek Orthodox monastery. Despite having a religious background and education, he later on became an atheist.

                    <strong>In 1876 Chekhov’s father was declared bankrupt</strong> and his family moved to Moscow, where they lived poverty-stricken. Chekhov stayed in Taganrog to sell the family possessions and to finish his education. At that time he widely read Turgenev, Cervantes, Goncharov, and Schopenhauer’s works, and he also wrote a full-length comedy drama “Fatherless”.

                    After three years<strong> he joined his family in Moscow</strong> and entered a medical school there. At the same time he was writing daily short, humorous sketches using a pen-name Antosha Chekhonte. The first book that brought Chekhov a prize was a collection of short stories “At Dusk”.

                <li>
                    Before long, <strong>Chekhov discovered that he suffered from tuberculosis</strong>. He often travelled to Yalta to improve his ill health. During one of such trips he met Leo Tolstoy and Maxim Gorky there.

                <li>
                    <strong>In 1892 he bought the small country estate of Melikhovo</strong>, which is about forty miles south of Moscow. Today, it’s a widely-visited museum. Chekhov died on July 15th 1904.

                    <strong>He left a great number of interesting stories and plays</strong> for next generations, including “The Cherry Orchard”, “The Lady with the Dog”, “Kashtanka”, “The Steppe”, “Three Sister”, and many others.
